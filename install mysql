sudo systemctl start mysqld
MySQL will bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default. Please reference our MySQL remote access guide for information on connecting to your databases using SSH.

Allowing unrestricted access to MySQL on a public IP not advised but you may change the address it listens on by modifying the bind-address parameter in /etc/my.cnf. If you decide to bind MySQL to your public IP, you should implement firewall rules that only allow connections from specific IP addresses.
